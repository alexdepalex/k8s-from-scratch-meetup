!SLIDE
**A successful installation and setup of Kubernetes?** 

However, a blackbox setup, what about troubleshooting, a more customized setup, etc

hands-on: [Kubernetes Installation with Vagrant & CoreOS](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/kubernetes-on-vagrant.html)

Troubleshooting (mac os):

```dyld: Library not loaded: /vagrant-substrate/staging/embedded/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/openssl
  Reason: image not found```

ensure openssl is installed
workaround: sudo ln -sf /usr/local/bin/openssl /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/openssl

!SLIDE
**Kubernetes setup the HARD way!** 

Kubernetes is working, what about the actual setup

Install kubectl on your machine

for mac:

```curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.3.4/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl```

!NOTE
- which of these technologies do you buy in to?
- will your knowledge still matter next year?
- what if you make the wrong decision?



!SLIDE
1. We start working on the **new platform**

2. The **old platform** starts catching on **fire**

3. They frantically **fix** the **old platform**

4. We have to continue **developing** the **new platform**

5. The **knowledge gap widens**

6. Rinse & **repeat**


!NOTE
- but it gets better
- very reminiscent of a book i've read

!SLIDE
Everything needs to be in the **cloud** before the **end of the year**! But the **team** is getting **smaller** and it's summer holiday season.

The old platform is **still breaking** left and right, and we have **3 months left**.

- helping hashicorp organise hashiconf
- how could we showcase the tools in a hands-on way?
- make it competitive!

!SLIDE
technical diagram.... WIP!!!!

!NOTE
- 3 hectic long days
- checker simple but powerful, can check solution automatically
- don't expose the checker to the outside world
- spin up infra with terraform on google cloud
- each contestant within a minute! (very impressive)

!SLIDE
You score **points** by **completing** data center automation focused **challenges** on Vault, Nomad, Consul and Terraform.

!NOTE
- everything was pre-configured
- contestants focus on using the tools vs. setup
- if solved, press button and automatically checked
- solved = points on leaderboard
- leaderboard per tool and overall

!SLIDE
People got really into it, even the **pros**. One participant even **missed the first day of talks**, because he too busy **finishing the challenges**.

!SLIDE
Surprised how **big an impact** the tool has, and how **efficient** and **interactive** this way of **learning new technologies** and accompanying **concepts** it is.

!NOTE
- feedback was amazing
- learning new tools through the challenges
- asked if they could use it internally to teach employees
- asked if they could use it as assessment tool
- done the challenge at meetups
- feedback always same: great way to learn new tools

!SLIDE
How can we **apply** this to **learning** and **transferring knowledge**?

!NOTE
- started creating challenges at my project for docker, consul, etc.
- teaches both the creator and the contestant
- challenges can teach even after we are gone
- can assess new employees

!SLIDE
- Gives you a **manageable** set of **tasks** and **subtasks**

- You can safely **learn from mistakes**

- There is **attention for achievements**

- You get to **explore other roles**

- It **directs** and **motivates** you when learning new things
